# PainLevelShiftDetection
pain level shift detection on the xite dataset and transfer learning to real medical dataset



This repository has the corresponding code for my master thesis in computer science. The idea is to classify two pain samples at the same 
time and test if they have the same pain level or the have different pain level. These results will be later transfered to real world 
medical data with the premise to recognize if pain medication did work and the pain level has shifted or the pain level didn't change 
and the pain drug didn't work or was a too small amount.
